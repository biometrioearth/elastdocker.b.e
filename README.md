# Setup

0. Execute steps 1 to 3 with elk-setup.sh script to run all the stack
     ```bash
     /bin/bash elk-setup.sh
     ```

Or follow the next steps:

1. Clone the Repository
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/biometrioearth/elastdocker.b.e.git  
     ```
2. Initialize Elasticsearch Keystore and TLS Self-Signed Certificates
    ```bash
    $ make setup
    ```
    > **For Linux's docker hosts only**. By default virtual memory [is not enough](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html) so run the next command as root `sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`
3. Start Elastic Stack
    ```bash
    $ make elk           <OR>         $ docker-compose up -d		<OR>		$ docker compose up -d
    ```
4. Visit Kibana at [https://localhost:5601](https://localhost:5601) or `https://<your_public_ip>:5601`

    Default Username: `elastic`, Password: `changeme`

    > - Notice that Kibana is configured to use HTTPS, so you'll need to write `https://` before `localhost:5601` in the browser.
    > - Modify `.env` file for your needs, most importantly `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` that setup your superuser `elastic`'s password, `ELASTICSEARCH_HEAP` & `LOGSTASH_HEAP` for Elasticsearch & Logstash Heap Size.
    
> Whatever your Host (e.g AWS EC2, Azure, DigitalOcean, or on-premise server), once you expose your host to the network, ELK component will be accessible on their respective ports. Since the enabled TLS uses a self-signed certificate, it is recommended to SSL-Terminate public traffic using your signed certificates. 

> üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è To start ingesting logs, you can start by running `make collect-docker-logs` which will collect your host's container logs.

# Configuration

* Some Configuration are parameterized in the `.env` file.
  * `ELASTIC_PASSWORD`, user `elastic`'s password (default: `changeme` _pls_).
  * `ELK_VERSION` Elastic Stack Version (default: `8.3.2`)
  * `ELASTICSEARCH_HEAP`, how much Elasticsearch allocate from memory (default: 1GB -good for development only-)
  * `LOGSTASH_HEAP`, how much Logstash allocate from memory.
  * Other configurations which their such as cluster name, and node name, etc.
* Elasticsearch Configuration in `elasticsearch.yml` at `./elasticsearch/config`.

**Logstash** section is where we need to put our files for pufferfish and others

* Logstash Configuration in `logstash.yml` at `./logstash/config/logstash.yml`.
* Logstash Pipeline in `main.conf` at `./logstash/pipeline/main.conf`.
* Kibana Configuration in `kibana.yml` at `./kibana/config`.
* Rubban Configuration using Docker-Compose passed Environment Variables.


### Setting Up Keystore

You can extend the Keystore generation script by adding keys to `./setup/keystore.sh` script. (e.g Add S3 Snapshot Repository Credentials)

To Re-generate Keystore:
```
make keystore
```

### Notes
<details><summary>Expand</summary>
<p>



- ‚ö†Ô∏è Elasticsearch HTTP layer is using SSL, thus mean you need to configure your elasticsearch clients with the `CA` in `secrets/certs/ca/ca.crt`, or configure client to ignore SSL Certificate Verification (e.g `--insecure` in `curl`).

- Adding Two Extra Nodes to the cluster will make the cluster depending on them and won't start without them again.

- Makefile is a wrapper around `Docker-Compose` commands, use `make help` to know every command.

- Elasticsearch will save its data to a volume named `elasticsearch-data`

- Elasticsearch Keystore (that contains passwords and credentials) and SSL Certificate are generated in the `./secrets` directory by the setup command.

- Make sure to run `make setup` if you changed `ELASTIC_PASSWORD` and to restart the stack afterwards.

- For Linux Users it's recommended to set the following configuration (run as `root`)
    ```
    sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
    ```
    By default, Virtual Memory [is not enough](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).

# Working with Elastic APM

After completing the setup step, you will notice a container named apm-server which gives you deeper visibility into your applications and can help you to identify and resolve root cause issues with correlated traces, logs, and metrics.

## Authenticating with Elastic APM

In order to authenticate with Elastic APM, you will need the following:

- The value of `ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN` defined in `.env` file as we have [secret token](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/guide/master/secret-token.html) enabled by default
- The ability to reach port `8200`
- Install elastic apm client in your application e.g. for NodeJS based applications you need to install [elastic-apm-node](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/nodejs/master/typescript.html)
- Import the package in your application and call the start function, In case of NodeJS based application you can do the following:

```
const apm = require('elastic-apm-node').start({
  serviceName: 'foobar',
  secretToken: process.env.ELASTIC_APM_SECRET_TOKEN,
  
  // https is enabled by default as per elastdocker configuration
  serverUrl: 'https://localhost:8200',
})
```
> Make sure that the agent is started before you require any other modules in your Node.js application - i.e. before express, http, etc. as mentioned in [Elastic APM Agent - NodeJS initialization](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/nodejs/master/express.html#express-initialization)

For more details or other languages you can check the following:
- [APM Agents in different languages](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/apm/agent/index.html)

# Monitoring The Cluster

### Via Self-Monitoring

Head to Stack Monitoring tab in Kibana to see cluster metrics for all stack components.

![Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16992394/156664539-cc7e1a69-f1aa-4aca-93f6-7aedaabedd2c.png)
![Moniroting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16992394/156664647-78cfe2af-489d-4c35-8963-9b0a46904cf7.png)

> In Production, cluster metrics should be shipped to another dedicated monitoring cluster.

### Via Prometheus Exporters
If you started Prometheus Exporters using `make monitoring` command. Prometheus Exporters will expose metrics at the following ports.

| **Prometheus Exporter**      | **Port**     | **Recommended Grafana Dashboard**                                         |
